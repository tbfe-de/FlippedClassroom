Implement two more member functions in class `vf_array`:

-   `begin()` should **return a POINTER to** the first
    element;
-   `end()` should **return a POINTER behind** the last
    element.

Again see the tests in `step_00/main.cpp` if you have no
idea how testing the correct behavior could be done.

Could it be these two member functions already suffice
to use the range-based for-loop?
