# Reference Tests

As the class `VF_Array` will have the same programming interface as
an `std::vector` basically the same set of tests should work for
both.

So as a starting point in the `main` program here an extensive set
of tests is provided which an `std::vector` all passes. Simply
copy these tests over from here to the class being developed.
