COPY OVER the file `vf_array.h` from the previous solution
==========================================================


Implement two more member functions in class `vf_array`:

`begin()` should return a POINTER the first element
`end()` should return a POINTER behind the last element

Again see the tests in `main.cpp` of step_00 if you
have no idea how testing the correct behavior could
be done.

Could it be that these two member functions already
suffice to use the range-based for-loop?
